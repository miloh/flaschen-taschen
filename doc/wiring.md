Wiring the crate
================

Looking from the back, the crate has the incoming data on the left bottom,
exit top left. We also have one power barrel connector on each crate, as well on the bottom
left.

The wiring is in a zig-zag pattern through the crate such that we reach the goal having
the incoming/outgoing cables at the right place.

## Tracing through the Crate

Here some schematic representation - Stars represent the bottle-necks, the arrows
the wiring between them. You can retrace that in the picture below.

## The power connection

The LED power inputs are long loose cables on both ends of the strip that we
combine and solder to a barrel-jack receptacle pig-tail, see image below.
Make sure to thread the wires from the LED _under_ the data wiring between the bottles.

As a preparation for soldering, the pigtail needs to be shortened by about 10cm (4 inches),
the LED power cables roughly by 6cm (2.5 inches) to not have too much slack. When removing outer
insulation from the pig-tail, make sure to not injure the insulation of the inner cables.

You don't have to unfold the whole LED strip or put it in the box to solder on the
power pigtail. Just do the whole process directly on the bundle of LEDs, it saves a lot of
time. The below images have the crate in the background for illustration purposes.

Uninsulate about 1 inch of the wires going to the LEDs and twist together the red
and blue ones separately. Put a ~1 inch of heat-shrink tubing up each pair now, so that we don't
forget that - move it up enough that it won't heat up while we solder.

Put about 1.5 inches of heat-shrink tubing wide enough to fit around the pigtail insulation now
as well - we need that later to tie everything together.

Now, uninsulate as well the wires on the pigtail about 1 inch. Now make a
[Lineman splice] with the corresponding wire-pair from the
LEDs (colors: red with red, white (pigtail) with blue (LED)). Solder the splice (it giving the
twisting, the whole length of the splice is now probably about 1/2 inch).

(If anything: remember the [Lineman splice] - it is a very useful skill!).

Move the heat-shrink that we have parked on the LED cables to each connection and shrink with
quick movements with a lighter (or, if that is not at hand, with the hot-air gun).

Let it cool so that it is hand-warm again. Then move the heat-shrink parked on the pigtail
up so that it squeezes the other heat-shrunk connection together and on the other end covers the
outer insulation of the pigtail. Shrink that. Now we have a sturdy connection.

(Use the heat shrink of which we have large rolls in the electronic area on the
left side on the shelf).

The Pigtail should be cable-tied to the crate for now. Later on we might want
a stress relief flap screwed to the wood ?

## The Result

This is how it looks when it is all connected within the final display: the
data connectors are chained from crate to crate. A separate spine with power
is supplying 5V to each crate individually.

Due to the cabeling, this is also fault tolerant: if power gets disconnected
on one crate, it will be powered, through GND/+5V line of the data cables, from
the two adjacent crates above and below.

All data and power connectors run up on the left side, so it is very simple to
stack crates without much thinking when moving the installation. The cable-ties
to secure the crates are the reusable kind.
